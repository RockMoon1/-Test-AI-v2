## üß™ Testing Your Setup

1. **Open the Demo Page**
   - Navigate to Interactive Demo
   - Alex chat is right at the top!

2. **Try These Test Messages:**
   ```
   "I have a big exam tomorrow and I'm stressed"
   "Help me create a study schedule for biology"
   "I keep getting distracted by my phone"
   "Give me motivation to finish this essay"
   ```

3. **Check It's Working:**
   - ‚úÖ Responses are unique and contextual
   - ‚úÖ Alex remembers previous messages
   - ‚úÖ Advice is specific to your question
   - ‚úÖ No "demo mode" warning

---

## üîß How It Works

### The Tech Stack:

1. **Frontend** (`AIAssistant.tsx`):
   - Collects user messages
   - Displays chat interface
   - Handles typing indicators

2. **Service Layer** (`aiService.ts`):
   - Routes to correct AI provider
   - Manages conversation history
   - Handles errors gracefully
   - Falls back to demo mode if API key missing

3. **API Integration**:
   - OpenAI: `https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions`
   - DeepSeek: `https://api.deepseek.com/v1/chat/completions`

### System Prompt:
Alex is configured with this personality:
```
"You are Alex, an AI study assistant for college students.
You help with study planning, task organization, motivation,
stress management, and goal setting.

You are friendly, supportive, and understand college life.
Keep responses concise (2-3 sentences) but meaningful.
Use occasional emojis. Focus on actionable advice."
```

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### ‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT - API Key Security:

1. **Never commit `.env` to Git**
   - Already in `.gitignore`
   - Double check before pushing

2. **Use Environment Variables**
   - Keys stay in `.env` file
   - Never hardcode in source code

3. **For Production:**
   - Use backend proxy (recommended)
   - Or use Supabase Edge Functions
   - Never expose keys in frontend

### Recommended Production Setup:

Instead of calling AI APIs directly from frontend:

```javascript
// Create a Supabase Edge Function
// Client calls: /functions/v1/chat
// Edge Function calls: OpenAI/DeepSeek API
// API key stays server-side only
```

---

## üé® Customizing Alex

### Change Personality:
Edit `src/services/aiService.ts`:
```javascript
const SYSTEM_PROMPT = `You are Alex, [your custom personality]`;
```

### Adjust Response Length:
```javascript
max_tokens: 150,  // Increase for longer responses
```

### Change Temperature:
```javascript
temperature: 0.7,  // 0 = focused, 1 = creative
```

## üìä Monitoring Usage

### Track API Costs:

1. **OpenAI:**
   - Dashboard: https://platform.openai.com/usage
   - Set up billing alerts
   - Monitor token usage

2. **DeepSeek:**
   - Check their platform dashboard

### Typical Usage:
- **Per conversation:** ~500-1000 tokens
- **Cost per conversation:** $0.001 - $0.002
- **1000 conversations:** ~$1-2

---

## üö® Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Using demo mode" message

**Solution:**
1. Check `.env` file has correct API key
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Clear browser cache
4. Check API key is valid on provider dashboard

---

### Issue: CORS errors

**Solution:**
This is normal during development. In production:
- Use Edge Functions to proxy requests
- Or enable CORS on your API provider

---

### Issue: Slow responses

**Possible causes:**
- First request of session (cold start)
- Provider API latency
- Long conversation history

**Solutions:**
- Limit conversation history to last 10 messages
- Use faster models (gpt-3.5-turbo is already fast)
- Add loading indicators (already included!)

---

## üéì Demo Mode vs Real AI

### Demo Mode (No API Key):
- Still works!
- Uses smart fallback responses
- Good for testing UI
- Shows warning message

### Real AI Mode (With API Key):
- Full conversational AI
- Context-aware responses
- Personalized advice
- No limits on conversation depth
