## Environment Variables

Currently no environment variables are required since this is a demo-only site.

When you're ready to add real functionality with Supabase:

```env
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
```

Add these to your deployment platform's environment variables.

## Custom Domain

### Vercel
1. Go to Project Settings → Domains
2. Add your custom domain
3. Update DNS records as instructed

### Netlify
1. Go to Site Settings → Domain Management
2. Add custom domain
3. Configure DNS settings

## Performance Optimization Tips

Your site is already optimized, but here are additional tips:

1. **Images**: Replace placeholder images with optimized WebP versions
2. **Fonts**: Consider self-hosting fonts for better performance
3. **Analytics**: Add Google Analytics or Plausible
4. **SEO**: Update meta tags in `index.html`
5. **Sitemap**: Generate sitemap.xml for better SEO

## Monitoring

### Recommended Tools
- **Vercel Analytics**: Built-in for Vercel deployments
- **Google Analytics**: For detailed user insights
- **Sentry**: For error tracking
- **Lighthouse**: For performance monitoring

## Testing Before Deployment

```bash
# Build for production
npm run build

# Preview production build locally
npm run preview

# Run type checking
npm run typecheck

# Run linting
npm run lint
```

## Post-Deployment Checklist

✅ Test all pages (Home, Demo, Portfolio)
✅ Verify all interactive demos work
✅ Test on mobile devices
✅ Check page load speed
✅ Verify all links work
✅ Test form submissions (if any)
✅ Check browser console for errors
✅ Test across different browsers

## Troubleshooting

### Build Fails
- Check Node.js version (18+ required)
- Delete `node_modules` and `package-lock.json`, then `npm install`
- Check for TypeScript errors: `npm run typecheck`

### 404 on Routes
For Single Page Applications, configure your host:

**Vercel**: Auto-configured
**Netlify**: Add `_redirects` file:
```
/*    /index.html   200
```

### Slow Loading
- Enable Gzip/Brotli compression (usually automatic)
- Use CDN for static assets
- Implement code splitting if needed

## Next Steps

Once deployed:
1. Share your site URL
2. Gather user feedback
3. Monitor analytics
4. Iterate based on insights
5. Consider adding real backend when ready
